We propose a mask occluded facial image de-occlusion system with Generative Adversarial Network for mask occluded facial image Age Estimation (LCA-GAN), and CNN models for age estimation. These systems are designed to overcome the performance degradation caused by mask occluded environment. Two open databases named as MORPH [1] and PAL [2] are used for experiments. LCA-GAN and age estimation models are opened to other researchers for fair judgement.
